The backend currently has multiple ways to visualize the data. All of the visualizations can be
reached at IP:Port/function, where IP and port are added in the .env file, and function is what
kind of visualization is wanted, e.g., localhost:8080/statelog.

Statelog
 The statelog shows all added readings contained in the backend, which is available at IP:Port/statelog.

Guiplotter
 GUI plot can be used to get a 3D space representation of all tag readings currently contained in
 the backend. Each tag can be highlighted to easily find its position in the 3D space. The GUI plot
 can be reached at IP:Port/plot.

SentLog
 Sentlog shows the forms that are prepared to be sent to the Epiroc server. All the information
 in the forms can be seen by clicking on the show data button. The sentlog can be found at
 IP:Port/sentlog.
