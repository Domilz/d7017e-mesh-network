# d7017e - Epiroc - Peer-to-peer mesh network for telemetary in mines 
Implementing a mesh network for Epiroc in the course D7017E.

# Project overview
Our project seeks to support Epiroc in its efforts to improve mine safety and productivity in the quickly developing sector of mine digitalization. They want us to investigate Mesh Networking's potential for enabling vehicle and person tracking in underground spaces. This designed specifically for mines that has not yet fully digitized. A peer-to-peer positioning protocol is being developed as a part of this project, which also entails looking into options for an efficient transport layer, and developing a backend system with position estimation capabilities and an Android application to tie this all together.
